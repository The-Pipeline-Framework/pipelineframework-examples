# Base Containerized Self-Hosted HA Reference

This directory runs the restaurant approval self-host path as the base compute-first HA local stack:

1. LocalStack provides DynamoDB, SQS, and S3-compatible endpoints.
2. One coordinator container owns control-plane APIs, release admin APIs, execution/await state, SQS work dispatch, DLQ publication, release metadata, artifact storage, and worker lifecycle.
3. One REST worker container hosts the same restaurant pipeline release and exposes the signed transition worker endpoint.

It uses the same `monolith-svc` image in two modes. The coordinator is configured with `pipeline.orchestrator.control-plane.require-remote-worker=true`, so it fails instead of silently falling back to local in-process execution.

`monolith-svc` is the packaged artifact shape. The runtime role is selected by configuration: one container enables coordinator/admin APIs and points at a remote worker, while the other enables the REST transition worker endpoint. For the general model, see [Coordinator And Worker Topology](/evolve/durable-coordinator/coordinator-worker-topology).

## Run The Happy Path

From the repository root:

```bash
./restaurant-approval/self-host/container/run-container-ha-demo.sh
```

The script:

1. resolves the configured released TPF runtime artifacts,
2. builds the restaurant `monolith-svc` Jib image,
3. starts LocalStack,
4. creates DynamoDB tables, SQS queues, and the S3 release artifact bucket,
5. starts the REST worker and coordinator containers,
6. registers and activates `pipeline-release.json`,
7. registers a healthy REST worker for the active release,
8. runs accepted and declined approval flows through `/tpf/control-plane/...`.

Set `TPF_SKIP_CONTAINER_BUILD=true` for faster reruns after the local image is current.
CI runs the same script with `--ci` so containers and volumes are always torn down after the proof completes.

## Run The Incident Path

```bash
./restaurant-approval/self-host/container/run-container-ha-incident.sh
```

This starts the same container stack, completes the await interaction with an intentionally invalid but API-valid restaurant decision, observes terminal failure through the durable coordinator, and calls the admin re-drive endpoint. The re-drive intentionally fails again because the bad payload is unchanged; this proves operator control without pretending unrecoverable input fixes itself.

## Run The Recovery Path

```bash
./restaurant-approval/self-host/container/run-container-ha-recovery.sh
```

This keeps LocalStack running while restarting runtime processes. The script submits one execution, waits for `WAITING_EXTERNAL`, restarts the coordinator, verifies the pending await state is still readable, completes the await, and verifies the result. It then submits another execution, restarts the REST worker, re-registers the worker lifecycle record, completes the await, and verifies the resumed transition succeeds through the restarted worker.

This is a process-restart proof, not a mid-transition crash injection test. It proves the durable stores survive coordinator and worker restarts at an await boundary, which is the deterministic recovery surface in this example.

## Local Defaults

| Variable | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `TPF_RESTAURANT_IMAGE` | `localhost/restaurant-approval/monolith-svc:latest` |
| `TPF_TENANT_ID` | `restaurant-demo` |
| `TPF_PIPELINE_ID` | `org.pipelineframework.restaurantapproval` |
| `TPF_COORDINATOR_PORT` | `8081` |
| `TPF_WORKER_PORT` | `8181` |
| `TPF_LOCALSTACK_PORT` | `4566` |
| `TPF_CONTROL_PLANE_TOKEN` | `restaurant-control-plane-admin-token` |
| `TPF_ADMIN_TOKEN` | `restaurant-control-plane-admin-token` |
| `TPF_WORKER_SECRET` | `restaurant-transition-worker-secret` |

These defaults are for local verification only. Real deployments should use secret references, platform-managed credentials, and externally managed DynamoDB/SQS/S3 resources.

## What This Proves

1. The coordinator can run as its own service and dispatch transition work to a separate worker service.
2. Execution, await, release, and worker lifecycle metadata use DynamoDB-compatible stores.
3. Work dispatch and execution DLQ use SQS-compatible queues.
4. Release artifact storage can use an S3-compatible blob store for coordinator-managed artifacts.
5. Worker lifecycle must report a healthy worker for the active release before hosted submissions are accepted.
6. Coordinator and worker process restarts do not lose parked await state or pinned release identity.

This is still a local reference stack, not a production deployment package. For milestone status and deferred hardening, see [Self-Hosted HA Roadmap](/evolve/durable-coordinator/self-hosted-ha-roadmap).
